# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a production-ready micro SaaS boilerplate built with Next.js App Router, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and NextAuth.js. The system features dynamic role-based access control (RBAC), multiple user dashboards, and a complete authentication system with both credential and OAuth providers.

## Glossary

- **RBAC System**: Role-Based Access Control system that manages user permissions through database-stored roles and permissions
- **NextAuth System**: Authentication system using NextAuth.js v5+ for handling user sessions and OAuth providers
- **Dashboard Layout**: Protected layout system with sidebar navigation, breadcrumbs, and user management
- **Public Layout**: Unprotected layout for marketing and authentication pages
- **Permission Module**: A logical grouping of related permissions (e.g., user management, analytics)
- **Route Protection Middleware**: Next.js middleware that validates user permissions before allowing access to protected routes
- **Admin UI**: Administrative interface for managing roles, permissions, and user assignments
- **Prisma ORM**: Database Object-Relational Mapping tool for PostgreSQL integration

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete TypeScript-based tech stack, so that I can build a type-safe and maintainable SaaS application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE NextAuth System SHALL use TypeScript for all configuration and authentication logic
2. THE Prisma ORM SHALL define all database models using TypeScript interfaces
3. THE RBAC System SHALL implement type-safe permission checking functions
4. THE Dashboard Layout SHALL use TypeScript for all component props and state management
5. WHERE Docker deployment is configured, THE NextAuth System SHALL support environment-based configuration through TypeScript

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want dynamic role-based access control stored in the database, so that I can manage user permissions without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE RBAC System SHALL store all roles in a database table with dynamic creation capabilities
2. THE RBAC System SHALL store all permissions in a database table linked to specific routes and modules
3. WHEN a new role is created, THE Admin UI SHALL allow assignment of permissions without requiring code deployment
4. THE Route Protection Middleware SHALL fetch user permissions from the database on each request
5. WHERE permission modules are added, THE RBAC System SHALL support new modules through database inserts only

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure authentication with multiple providers, so that I can access the application using my preferred login method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE NextAuth System SHALL support credential-based authentication with email and password
2. THE NextAuth System SHALL support Google OAuth authentication
3. WHEN a user authenticates, THE NextAuth System SHALL retrieve and attach role information to the session
4. THE NextAuth System SHALL integrate with the RBAC System to determine user permissions
5. WHERE authentication fails, THE NextAuth System SHALL provide clear error messages and redirect appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with different roles, I want role-specific dashboards, so that I can access features appropriate to my permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user accesses /admin/dashboard, THE Dashboard Layout SHALL display admin-specific navigation and features
2. WHEN a customer user accesses /customer/dashboard, THE Dashboard Layout SHALL display customer-specific navigation and features
3. THE Route Protection Middleware SHALL prevent unauthorized access to role-specific dashboard routes
4. WHERE a user lacks required permissions, THE Route Protection Middleware SHALL redirect to an appropriate error page
5. THE Dashboard Layout SHALL display user avatar, role information, and contextual navigation based on permissions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want accessible public pages, so that I can learn about the service and create an account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Public Layout SHALL provide a landing page with pricing information and call-to-action buttons
2. THE Public Layout SHALL include login, signup, about, and contact pages accessible without authentication
3. THE Public Layout SHALL implement responsive design using TailwindCSS for all screen sizes
4. THE Public Layout SHALL meet WCAG accessibility standards for navigation and content
5. WHERE users are authenticated, THE Public Layout SHALL provide navigation to appropriate dashboard areas

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want a management interface for roles and permissions, so that I can configure access control without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Admin UI SHALL provide a interface for creating, editing, and deleting roles
2. THE Admin UI SHALL allow assignment and removal of permissions to roles
3. THE Admin UI SHALL provide a interface for assigning roles to users
4. WHEN permissions are modified, THE Admin UI SHALL immediately reflect changes in user access
5. THE Admin UI SHALL display current role and permission assignments in a clear, organized manner

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-organized code structure and reusable components, so that I can maintain and extend the application efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE NextAuth System SHALL be organized under /lib with clear separation of concerns
2. THE Dashboard Layout SHALL use reusable UI components from /components/ui directory
3. THE RBAC System SHALL provide utility functions and hooks for permission checking
4. THE Prisma ORM SHALL define database schemas in a centralized schema file
5. WHERE API routes are needed, THE NextAuth System SHALL provide examples under /api directory

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want production deployment capabilities, so that I can deploy the application to various environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE NextAuth System SHALL support Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
2. THE Prisma ORM SHALL provide database migration scripts for PostgreSQL
3. THE NextAuth System SHALL use environment variables for all configuration settings
4. WHERE deployment occurs, THE NextAuth System SHALL provide example .env files for different environments
5. THE RBAC System SHALL support database seeding for initial roles and permissions

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want testing capabilities and error handling, so that I can ensure application reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE RBAC System SHALL include unit tests for permission checking logic
2. THE NextAuth System SHALL include integration tests for authentication flows
3. THE Dashboard Layout SHALL implement consistent error boundaries and loading states
4. WHERE API errors occur, THE NextAuth System SHALL provide structured error responses
5. THE Admin UI SHALL include form validation and error handling for all user inputs

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want permission-based UI rendering, so that users only see features they can access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE RBAC System SHALL provide a useHasPermission hook for conditional component rendering
2. WHEN a user lacks specific permissions, THE Dashboard Layout SHALL hide related navigation items
3. THE Admin UI SHALL only display management features to users with administrative permissions
4. WHERE permission checks are needed, THE RBAC System SHALL provide both client and server-side validation
5. THE Dashboard Layout SHALL gracefully handle permission changes during active sessions
