# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for improving the sidebar UI and UX in the Micro SaaS application. The current sidebar implementation provides basic functionality with collapsible behavior, role-based navigation, and user information display. The improvements aim to enhance visual appeal, user experience, interaction patterns, and overall usability while maintaining the existing RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) functionality.

## Glossary

- **Sidebar**: The vertical navigation panel on the left side of the dashboard that contains navigation links, user information, and system controls
- **Dashboard Layout**: The main layout component that wraps the dashboard pages and includes the sidebar and header
- **RBAC**: Role-Based Access Control system that determines which navigation items are visible based on user roles and permissions
- **Collapsed State**: A minimized sidebar view showing only icons without text labels
- **Navigation Item**: A clickable link in the sidebar that navigates to a specific page or section
- **Active State**: Visual indication showing which navigation item corresponds to the current page
- **User Session**: The authenticated user's data including name, email, avatar, and roles
