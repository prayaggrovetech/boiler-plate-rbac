## Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE password_reset_tokens (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  token TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  expires TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  createdAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Manual Testing Checklist

### Forgot Password Flow
- [ ] Visit /forgot-password
- [ ] Enter valid email
- [ ] Check server console for reset URL
- [ ] Verify token in database
- [ ] Visit reset URL
- [ ] Enter new password
- [ ] Verify password strength indicator
- [ ] Submit form
- [ ] Verify success message
- [ ] Login with new password

### Change Password Flow
- [ ] Login to account
- [ ] Visit /settings
- [ ] Enter current password
- [ ] Enter new password
- [ ] Verify password strength indicator
- [ ] Submit form
- [ ] Verify success message
- [ ] Logout and login with new password

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Try to reuse reset token
- [ ] Try expired token (wait 1 hour)
- [ ] Try weak passwords
- [ ] Try same password as current
- [ ] Test OAuth user (should show message)

## Production Considerations

### Email Service Integration
Currently, reset URLs are logged to console. For production:
1. Integrate email service (SendGrid, Resend, AWS SES, etc.)
2. Create email template with reset link
3. Add email sending to forgot-password API
4. Set up email delivery monitoring

### Environment Variables
Add to `.env`:
```
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://yourdomain.com
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
EMAIL_SERVICE_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

### Monitoring
- Track password reset requests
- Monitor token expiry rates
- Alert on suspicious activity
- Log failed reset attempts

## Test Coverage Summary
- ✅ Unit Tests: API endpoints validated
- ✅ Integration Tests: Full flow tested
- ✅ Security Tests: Validation and token handling
- ✅ UI Tests: All pages load correctly
- ⏳ Manual Tests: Recommended before production

## Conclusion
All automated tests passed successfully. The password reset and change password functionality is working as expected with proper security measures in place. Ready for manual testing and production deployment after email service integration.
